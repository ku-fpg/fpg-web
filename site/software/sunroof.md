Sunroof
=======

<div class="teaser">

Sunroof is a monadic Javascript compiler. It provides a deep EDSL
for Javascript. As such it allows to express Javascript computations
in Haskell using a monad. This captures the sequential nature of
Javascript. At the same time Sunroof offers a threading model
built on top Javascript, which gives users the possibility to
write Javascript using Haskell concurrency patterns. This
makes it easy to use Haskell abstractions for larger Javascript
applications without obscuring the produced Javascript on the Haskell
level. In combination with the Kansas-Comet server project
Sunroof offers a great platform to build interactive web applications,
giving the ability to interleave Haskell and Javascript computations
with each other as needed.
