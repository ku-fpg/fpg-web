## Kansas Lava

<div class="teaser">
        
Kansas Lava is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for expressing
hardware-oriented descriptions of computations, and is hosted inside the
language Haskell. Kansas Lava programs are descriptions of specific
hardware entities, the connections between them, and other computational
abstractions that can compile down to these entities. Large circuits
have be successfully expressed using Kansas Lava, and Haskell's powerful
abstraction mechanisms, as well as generic generative techniques, can be
applied to good effect to provide descriptions of highly efficient
circuits.
