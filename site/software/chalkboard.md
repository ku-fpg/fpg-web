# ChalkBoard

<div class="teaser">
ChalkBoard was a Haskell-hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for image
generation and processing. The basic structure was a chalk "Board", a
two-dimensional canvas of values, typically colors. **It has been
subsumed by the [diagrams](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/)
effort.**
