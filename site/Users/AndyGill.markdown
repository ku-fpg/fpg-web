 Research
--------

I lead the [Functional Programming Group](/index) at the University of Kansas.
Funded by the National Science Foundation, 
the International Foundation for Telemetering, and others,
we use functional programming to solve problems in ways that are
amicable to acceleration, and supports
assurance arguments. As a group we make aggressive use of functional languages,
extending the technology where needed, and ultimately strive to close
gaps between high level specifications and highly efficient
implementations. We then deploy our new technologies into diverse
application areas, including telemetry, high performance computing and
real-time systems.

Teaching
--------

I teach programming in Java (EECS 168 &amp; 368), 
Scheme (EECS 368), and Haskell (EECS 368, 776, 876). 
In all these class, we go on to use programming
to solve interesting real-world problems.

Bio and Background
------------------

Andrew (Andy) Gill was born and educated in Scotland, and has spent his
professional career in the United States. Andy received his Ph.D. from
the University of Glasgow in 1996, then spent three years in industry as
a compiler developer, and a year in academia as a principal project
scientist. He co-founded Galois in 2000, a technology transfer company
that used language technologies to create trustworthiness in critical
systems. In 2008 he returned to academia and research, joining the
University of Kansas and the Information and Telecommunication
Technology Center.

Andy believes that functional languages like Haskell are a great medium
for expressing algorithms and solving problems. Since returning to
academia, he has targeted the application area of telemetry,
specializing in generating circuits from specifications. His research
interests include optimization, language design, debugging, and
dependability. The long-term goal of his research is to offer software
engineers and functional language practitioners the opportunity to write
clear and high-level executable specifications that can realistically be
compiled into efficient implementations.

Under the supervision
of Russ Green, Andy built a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for the
interpreted Edinburgh ML, and a hotspot-like profiler to selectively
detect candidate functions for recompilation.

</div><div class="span2">

While studying for his PhD under the supervision of [Simon Peyton
Jones](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/), Andy
developed the popular foldr/build fusion optimization, still used to
this day inside the [Glasgow Haskell
compiler](http://www.haskell.org/ghc).
Andy also did postdoctoral studies at Glasgow, under [John
O'Donnell](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jtod), working on interactive
rewrite engines.

</div><div class="span2">

Andy spend three years as a professional compiler engineer, working
first for HP on and optimizer for the itanium, worked at Metrowerks on a
Java JIT for the PowerPC, and for a small startup call Semantic Designs,
maintaining a parallel compiler for a scheme-like language.

</div><div class="span2">

At OGI, Andy helped Microsoft with their .NET initiative, and developed
debugging technologies for Haskell.

</div><div class="span2">

Partnering with colleagues from OGI, Andy co-founded Galois, a
consulting company specializing in high assurance software. Galois grew
from a team of four in 2000 to a team of over 35 employees and revenue
of $7.5M in 2008.

</div><div class="span2">

While at KU, Andy has been focusing on Domain Specific Languages
and practical applications for the Worker/Wrapper transformation.
