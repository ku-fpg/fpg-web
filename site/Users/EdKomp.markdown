Ed Komp joined ITTC in September 1998. He has more than 15 years
experience in designing, implementing, and managing commercial software
products. His primary interests include specialized computer language
design for application specific domains, functional programming,
software development environments, and networking. He received his B.A.
in mathematics and his M.S. in computer science from KU in 1976 and
1979, respectively. He was the primary software architect for the Block
Oriented System Simulator (BOSS) and helped found a local company to
commercialize this tool. He also was the primary software architect and
manager for the Block Oriented Network Simulator (BONeS), a second
commercial product success. Cadence Design Systems eventually purchased
the start-up company that Komp co-founded. He stayed with the company
and continued to specialize in graphical simulation tools.
