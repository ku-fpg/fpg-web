<div class="teaser">

We develop programming-language theory to support our software.
Our main theoretical interest is program transformation, including compilation between languages, improving the efficiency of a program within a language, or transforming data types to allow compatibility with common interfaces (such as type classes).

</div>

This page overviews the theory we are currently developing to support our research.
We also maintain a [Software](/software) webpage,
which describes the software that we are developing that puts this theory to use.
