Classes at KU
-------------

EECS 168 **Programming I** introduces problem solving using a high
level programming language and object oriented software design.
Fundamental stages of software development are discussed: problem
specification, program design, implementation, testing, and
documentation. Introduction to programming using object oriented
language: using classes, defining classes, and extending classes.
Introduction to algorithms and data structures useful for problem
solving: arrays, lists, files, searching, and sorting. Student will
be responsible for designing, implementing, testing and documenting
independent programming projects. Professional ethics are defined and
discussed in particular with respect to computer rights and
responsibilities.

EECS 368 **Programming Language Paradigms** is an introduction to
programming language fundamentals. The objective of the course is to
provide an introduction to alternative programming models that
compliment the traditional imperative models taught in introductory
courses. The course will provide theoretical insight into various
aspects of modern languages while requiring hands-on development of
programs using Java, Scheme, and Haskell.

EECS 776 **Functional Programming and Domain Specific Languages**, 
also known as EECS 700 and EECS 690, teaches how to solve engineering
problems efficiently in a modern functional language. Topics may include
basic functional idioms, introduction to Haskell, IO and purity,
functional data structures and algorithms, monads and applicative
functors, parsing combinators, DSLs and hardware description DSLs,
advanced type systems, making assurance arguments, testing and
debugging. These topics will be explored using a hands-on style with
case studies, program assignments and projects.

EECS 800 **Implementing Functional Languages** explores the science and
engineering of efficiently executing functional programming languages.
The class cover all the major techniques used in real functional
language compilers to optimize their programs. This will be a practical
class, with examples taken from the Glasgow Haskell compiler, the TIMBER
compiler, and other systems. There will also be reading assignments of
ACM SIGPLAN implementation papers.

EECS 800 **High Assurance Engineering using Functional Languages**
explores language-based techniques for writing high assurance software.
In particular, the classes surveys all the major techniques developed
over the last 20 years by the functional programming community since
moving beyond straightforward functions and data-structures. There will
also be reading assignments of ACM SIGPLAN papers.
