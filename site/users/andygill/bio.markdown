Andrew (Andy) Gill was born and educated in Scotland, and has spent his
professional career in the United States. Andy received his Ph.D. from
the University of Glasgow in 1996, then spent three years in industry as
a compiler developer, and a year in academia as a principal project
scientist. He co-founded Galois in 2000, a technology transfer company
that used language technologies to create trustworthiness in critical
systems. In 2008 he returned to academia and research, joining the
University of Kansas and the Information and Telecommunication
Technology Center.

Andy believes that functional languages like Haskell are a great medium
for expressing algorithms and solving problems. Since returning to
academia, he has targeted the application area of telemetry,
specializing in generating circuits from specifications. His research
interests include optimization, language design, debugging, and
dependability. The long-term goal of his research is to offer software
engineers and functional language practitioners the opportunity to write
clear and high-level executable specifications that can realistically be
compiled into efficient implementations.
