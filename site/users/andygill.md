Research
--------

I lead the [Functional Programming Group](/index) at the University of Kansas.
Funded by the National Science Foundation,
the International Foundation for Telemetering, and others,
we use functional programming to solve problems in ways that are
amicable to acceleration, and supports
assurance arguments. As a group we make aggressive use of functional languages,
extending the technology where needed, and ultimately strive to close
gaps between high level specifications and highly efficient
implementations. We then deploy our new technologies into diverse
application areas, including telemetry, high performance computing and
real-time systems.

Teaching
--------

I teach programming in Java (EECS 168 &amp; 368),
Scheme (EECS 368), and Haskell (EECS 368, 776, 876).
In all these class, we go on to use programming
to solve interesting real-world problems.

--------  --------------
EECS 168  Programming I
EECS 368  Programming Language Paradigms
EECS 776  Functional Programming and Domain Specific Languages
EECS 876  Advanced Topics in Functional Languages
--------  --------------

I am teaching Programming I (EECS 168) in Spring 2013.

Bio and Background
------------------

Andrew (Andy) Gill was born and educated in Scotland, and has spent his
professional career in the United States. Andy received his Ph.D. from
the University of Glasgow in 1996, then spent three years in industry as
a compiler developer, and a year in academia as a principal project
scientist. He co-founded Galois in 2000, a technology transfer company
that used language technologies to create trustworthiness in critical
systems. In 2008 he returned to academia and research, joining the
University of Kansas and the Information and Telecommunication
Technology Center.

Andy believes that functional languages like Haskell are a great medium
for expressing algorithms and solving problems.
Since returning to academia, he has targeted the application areas of
telemetry and signal processing, specializing in generating high performance
circuits from specifications. His research interests include optimization,
language design, debugging, and dependability. The long-term goal of his
research is to offer engineers and practitioners the opportunity to write
clear and high-level executable specifications that can realistically be
compiled into efficient implementations.
