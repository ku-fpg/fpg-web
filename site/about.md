# The Functional Programming Group

<div class="teaser">

The Functional Programming Group, led by Andy Gill, apply and extend
functional programming technologies to the diverse areas of building
computer systems, high-performance computing, information assurance and
telemetry. We use functional programming to bring clarity to
descriptions of what we want to compute, and computer language
technologies to provide efficiency and assurance. Typically, we
collaborate with other research groups, deploying our technology and
bringing our research and development expertise to work on our
collaborators' open issues, as well as their assurance and performance
needs.

</div>

We operate inside the Computer Systems Design Laboratory (CSDL), at
ITTC. CDSL also hosts the [System Level Design
Group](https://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/sldg_wiki/index.php/Main_Page) (SLDG),
lead by [Perry Alexander](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~alex/), who also uses
functional programming for system engineering, and with whom we
collaborate closely.


Joining the Lab
---------------

New members (that are already at KU) are always welcome. Typically, at the graduate level you
will need some experience in Haskell (for example, via [EECS 776](/users/andygill/teaching)).
Email Professor Gill for a discussion.

If you are not at KU, and are not planning on applying to KU,
then please outline how you know Haskell, or another functional
language. The lab does not offer scholarships to outside students,
though we have people join from other graduate programs from
time to time.

## Visits

[Andrew Farmer](/users/andrewfarmer) is spending Spring 2013 at Portland State University,
working with the FP group there.


### Other

SLDG and FPG jointly run the [LAMBDA reading
group](https://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/lambda/Main_Page) for anyone that is
interested, discussing topics related to programming and specification
languages, semantic models, and programming paradigms.

We have an IRC group, **#ku-csdl**, on irc.freenode.net.
We also use a subreddit, <code>/r/csdl/</code>,
and use github <https://github.com/ku-fpg/>.
