<div class="teaser">

We build tools and libraries, typically written in Haskell, to explore and validate our
ideas. The main research challenge we are addressing is improving the
high assurance narrative for functional languages. We release our tools
open source, under a BSD license, use git for version control, and
github for external contributions.

This page is a software-centric view of our research. Please email us if you
are interested in contributing, or want more details about a specific
tool. We also maintain a [Research Projects](/research) webpage,
which gives the research-centric view of the FPG lab.

Other Libraries
---------------

All these libraries are on hackage.

-   [dotgen](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dotgen) A simple
    interface for building .dot graph files, for input into the dot and
    graphviz tools. It includes a monadic interface for building graphs.
-   [httpd-shed](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/httpd-shed) A
    trivial web server that can be used to build Ajax and other
    interactive applications in Haskell.
-   [io-reactive](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-reactive) An API
    for generating reactive objects that mimic the reactive model used
    used in the TIMBER programming language.
-   [marked-pretty](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/marked-pretty) A
    compatible extension to pretty that allows marking and scoping of
    the output document. A typical application is outputting pretty HTML
    with style attributes like bold and color.
-   [sized-types](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sized-types)
    Providing indices, matrixes, sparse matrixes, and signed and
    unsigned bit vectors.
