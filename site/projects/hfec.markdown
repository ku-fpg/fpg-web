# HFEC Project

<div class="teaser">

On this project, we used [Kansas Lava](/projects/kansas-lava) to generate efficient forward
error correcting codes. From a FPG research point of view, we were attempting
to to answer the following questions:

-   Can we use use functional programming to complement and support the
    current development module of using MATLAB for a reference, and VHDL
    for an implementation.
-   Can we build a functional program that mitigates against the need to
    perform frequent refactorings when working in VHDL, as a suitable
    architecture is discovered.
-   Can we gain a stronger assurance of the relationship between the
    specification and implementation?
-   What are the weaknesses of using a system like Lava to implement a
    FEC, and what are the remaining research problems with using EDSLs
    as an architecture bridge.

The project had a period of performance of May 2009 to Aug 2011.

There were a number of publications that came directly out of this project.

 * <div class="cite Gill:11:GeneratingLDPC"/>
 * <div class="cite Werling:09:ITC"/>
 * <div class="cite Bull:09:ITC"/> 
 
There are also background papers about Kansas Lava from the same time period
that we indirect influenced by the needs of the project.
