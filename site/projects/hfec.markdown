# HFEC Project

<div class="teaser">

On this project, we used [Kansas Lava](/projects/kansas-lava) to generate efficient forward
error correcting codes. From a research point of view, we were attempting
to to answer the following questions:

-   Can we use use functional programming to complement and support the
    current development module of using MATLAB for a reference, and VHDL
    for an implementation.
-   Can we build a functional program that mitigates against the need to
    perform frequent refactorings when working in VHDL, as a suitable
    architecture is discovered.
-   Can we gain a stronger assurance of the relationship between the
    specification and implementation?
-   What are the weaknesses of using a system like Lava to implement a
    FEC, and what are the remaining research problems with using EDSLs
    as an architecture bridge.
