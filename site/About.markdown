The Functional Programming Group
================================

<div class="teaser">


The Functional Programming Group, led by Andy Gill, apply and extend
functional programming technologies to the diverse areas of building
computer systems, high-performance computing, information assurance and
telemetry. We use functional programming to bring clarity to
descriptions of what we want to compute, and computer language
technologies to provide efficiency and assurance. Typically, we
collaborate with other research groups, deploying our technology and
bringing our research and development expertise to work on our
collaborators' open issues, as well as their assurance and performance
needs.

Computer Systems Design Laboratory
----------------------------------

We operate inside the Computer Systems Design Laboratory (CSDL), at
ITTC. CDSL also hosts the [System Level Design
Group](https://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/sldg_wiki/index.php/Main_Page) (SLDG),
lead by [Perry Alexander](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~alex/), who also uses
functional programming for system engineering, and with whom we
collaborate closely.

IRC
---

We have an IRC group, `#ku-csdl`, on irc.freenode.net.

LAMBDA Reading Group
--------------------

SLDG and FPG jointly run the [LAMBDA reading
group](https://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/lambda/Main_Page) for anyone that is
interested, discussing topics related to programming and specification
languages, semantic models, and programming paradigms.

Joining the Lab
---------------

New members are always welcome. Typically, at the graduate level you
will need some experience in Haskell (for example, via [EECS 776](/Members/AndyGill/Teaching/EECS776)).
Email Professor Gill for a discussion.
