About the HERMIT Project
------------------------

The Haskell Equational Reasoning Model-to-Implementation Tunnel (HERMIT)
is a two year NSF-funded project to improving the Applicability of
Haskell-Hosted Semi-Formal Models to High Assurance Development.
Specifically, HERMIT will use the [?\>worker/wrapper
transformation](/csdl/fpg/Research/WorkerWrapper), a Haskell-hosted DSL,
and a new refinement UI to perform rewrites directly on Haskell Core,
the [GHC](http://www.haskell.org/ghc) internal representation.

This project is a substantial case study into the application of
worker/wrapper on larger examples. In particular, we want to demonstrate
the equivalences between efficient Haskell programs, and their clear,
specification-style Haskell counterparts. In doing so, there are several
open problems, including refinement scripting and management scaling
issues, data representation and presentation challenges, and
understanding the theoretical boundaries of the worker/wrapper
transformation. In the project, there will be ample time for publishing
research results, building a useful and state-of-the art semi-formal
refinement toolkit, and being part of the wider functional programming
community.
